Law of the West C64 NTSC

Partially disassembled and commented

When I first played this game, I was fascinated by its branching dialogue system and the many possible outcomes of each conversation.

I often wondered:

	* How is the final score calculated?
	* What triggers all six robbery scenes?
	* How could I explore every dialogue option and consequence without replaying the game hundreds of times?
	
Back then, the answers were out of reach. Today, they are at hand.

To uncover them, I partially disassembled the game, focusing on its scoring and dialogue systems. 

Start with the "Overview" file.
